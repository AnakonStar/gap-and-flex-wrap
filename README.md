## ```flex-wrap``` tag

It can be used to adjust some items in a list, such as header navs and cards, it will automatically rearrange the items in a container according with the screen size, but it won't affect the items size, which is perfect to use with ```media-screen```


## ```gap``` tag

The best way to use it's with the ```flex-wrap```, with both you can do things like a list of cards ordered in column or row, and only between then add a gap, not affecting the outer, like when you use margin
